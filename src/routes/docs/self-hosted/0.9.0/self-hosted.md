# Gitpod Self-Hosted

Gitpod, just as you know it from [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io), can be deployed and operated on your own infrastructure. It supports different cloud providers, self-managed Kubernetes clusters, corporate firewalls, and even off-grid / air-gapped networks.

## Installation

You can find all configuration templates and installation scripts in the Gitpod repository:

### Install on Google Cloud Platform

The easiest way to install Gitpod Self-Hosted is currently on Google Cloud Platform (that's also where [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io) is deployed). GCP is the recommended platform for most users:

### Install on any Kubernetes cluster

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, or don't want/cannot use GCP, please follow the generic guide:

Note: Dedicated installation steps for Azure and OpenShift are on our roadmap.
